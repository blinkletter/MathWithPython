# # Python vs. Microsoft Excel
# 
# Microsoft **Excel** is great for small jobs and good at large ones. But when we get huge, we turn to databases and "real" data analysis systems. Using *R* or *Python* tools is a common destination when data gets **big**. There are many other options, but we will be sticking with the same tool for all our exercises: ***Python***. The goal is not to teach programing, but to teach how these tools are **useful** and just enough *Python* code to use these notebooks that are already set up for you.
# 
# You can go deeper. Much deeper. In the depths, the true power awaits.

# ## *Pandas*
# *Excel* has **rows and columns**. Columns often have headings. We could do all of this in simple *Python* with lists of lists and other clumsy data structures but there is a tool that can make things simple, *Pandas*. ***Pandas*** is a package that provides a data object called a "**dataframe**" and  tools for using this object. We will learn by doing and so will leave the details until later. First we must **load the package**. Use the code below to do so. 

# In[1]:


import pandas as pd   #import the pandas tools and rename the whole set as "pd"


# ## Getting Data
# 
# We can get a data set two ways: we can **type it in** or we can **read** a data file. The first way is very *Excel*, isn't it. For small jobs we can just enter the data and then go mess with it. The second way is more practical. The data may already in a **digital format**: it might be written in your assignment and presented in PDF format, it may be available as a **data file** (in various formats) on the course web site, it could have been **generated** by your lab instrument and saved on a thumb drive, or you might be **cutting and pasting** from the web.
# 
# We will consider two methods: **manual** data entry and **reading** a data set from a file.

# ### Manual Entry
# 
# *Excel* has **rows and columns**. *Pandas* **dataframes** contains series (columns) and indexes (rows) of data. Each series can have a name (and also, each index can be identified by a name if you wish). These dataframes can be **addressed** by series name (column header) or by index (row), just like *Excel* **spreadsheets**. I will be using the terms "columns" and "rows" as we go forward, to keep things simple.
# 
# Examine the code below. First we create the data. We created a **list** of data pairs. Each pair is a **row**. We then designated the **columns** with names. We can address the columns by name or by position (column 0 or 1).

# In[2]:


data = [[1, 4], [2, 5], [3, 6]]   # Create a list of data row lists
df = pd.DataFrame(data)           # Convert the list of lists into a dataframe object
df.columns = ["cows","sheep"]     # Set the column headers to specific values
print(df)                         # Report the dataframe object


# The data is presented in a dataframe. The columns have been **labeled** as "cows" and "sheep". The rows are **indexed** with 0,1,and 2 (but we can change that). Consider the following and try to understand what happened.

# In[3]:


df = df.rename(columns={"cows": "dog"})   # Rename the "cows" column to "dog"
df.index = ['A','B','C']                  # Set the index values to a list of letters
df = df.rename(index={"A": "E"})          # Rename the "A" index to "E"
print(df)                                 # Report the dataframe object


# There are many tools that can **manipulate** the dataframe. Just as an *Excel* spreadsheet has functions that can operate on the data, ***Pandas*** has methods and functions that can do the same. We will learn a few of these tools as we move forward. For more information see the [documentation](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/frame.html).

# ### Another Example and Comparing *Excel* and *Pandas* Definitions
# Observe how the function call that **creates** a dataframe can set the column names (and also the row names, if we choose to do so). In this example we will create a **dataframe** that parallels an *Excel* **spreadsheet**. (`NaN` is the *Python* placeholder for "Not a Number").

# In[4]:


comparisons = [["Worksheet","Dataframe"],
               ["Column","Series"],
               ["Row","Index"],
               ["Empty cell","NaN"]]
df = pd.DataFrame(comparisons,  columns=["Excel", "pandas"]) 
print(df)                                                           


# ### Reading Data From a file
# Rather than manually enter the dataframe data into a list (or a *NumPy* array), we can **import** a set of data from a file. The *Pandas* package has many tools for importing various **data formats**. We will import a "**comma separated value**" file, also know as a **csv** file. The file is available on the moodle site and the content of the data file is reproduced below.
# 
# ```
# Excel,pandas
# Worksheet,Dataframe
# Column,Series
# Row,Index
# Empty cell,NaN
# ```
# 
# `pandas.read_csv` will assume the **first line** is the names of the **data series** (columns)

# In[5]:


df = pd.read_csv("E1_data.csv")              # pandas provides tools for reading files
print(df)                                        # Report the dataframe object


# The *data.csv* file must be in the same directory as this notebook. If not then the **file path** must be specified.

# ## Operating on the Data
# The dataframe object contains **columns and rows** of data. A typical dataframe will have columns of data that are identified by the column heading and rows identified by an index (usually a range of numbers from zero to n-1). Let us import a data file called `data2.csv` that contains data for concentration over time in a **first-order reaction**.
# 

# In[6]:


df = pd.read_csv("E1_data2.csv", delimiter = "\t") # This data file uses tabs 
print(df)                                                 # Report the dataframe object


# In a first-order reaction, we can find the **rate constant**, *k*, by **plotting** the linear form of the equation. We need to plot the natural logarithm of the concentration of reactant *vs.* time. We can add a new column by a simple math **operation**. Consider the following...

# In[7]:


import numpy                                 # import a giant set of math tools

df["ln_conc"] = numpy.log(df["conc"])        # numpy.log() is ln (log base e). 
df["1/time"] = 1/df["time"]                  # Make a new column for 1/time
df["1/time*time"] = df["time"]*df["1/time"]  # We can multiply series together. 
print(df)                                    # Report the dataframe object


# In[8]:


df = df.drop(columns=["1/time","1/time*time"])  # drop coluns we don't need 
print(df)                                       # Report the dataframe object


# ## A Quick Intro to Plotting
# 
# The `matplotlib.pyplot` package contains the **tools** needed for making plots. Calling a plotting function creates an plot **object** that persists and can be added to and modified by other *MatPlotLib* tools.  Finally it is **visualized** by calling the `plt.show()` function. This **displays** the plot and **clears** the plot object (try calling the function a second time and see what you get.)
# 
# The **plot style** parameter can be expressed as a short string of characters denoting **color** ('k' = black), **marker** ('o' = circle) and **line** ('-' = solid line).

# In[9]:


import matplotlib.pyplot as plt            # import plotting tools

plt.plot(df["time"],df["ln_conc"], "ko-")  # plot the data. 
plt.xlabel("time (seconds)")               # add/change the x- and y-axis labels 
plt.ylabel("ln(conc)")
plt.title("First Order Reaction")          # add/change the title of the plot 
plt.show()                                 # display and clear the plot 


# ## Linear Regression
# For a first-order reaction, we know that the **relationship** of observed concentration, *C<sub>t</sub>*, and time, *t*, is dependant on the initial concentration, *C<sub>0</sub>*, and the rate consant, *k*.
# 
# $$C_t=C_0\cdot e^{-kt}$$
# 
# And we can apply the natural log function to this equation to create the following **linear form**.
# 
# $$\ln(C_t)=ln(C_0)-k\cdot t$$
# 
# We now see that a plot of ln(*C<sub>t</sub>*) vs. *t* will have a **slope** of *â€“k* and an **intercept** of ln *C<sub>t</sub>*
# 
# The ***SciPy* library** contains many tools for **scientific data analysis**. We will use a tool that performs a standard **linear regression** on *x,y* data. Calling the `sciply.stats.linregress()` function will return an object that **contains** all the parameters of the linear regression fit. Consider the following.

# In[10]:


import scipy.stats

fit = scipy.stats.linregress(df["time"],df["ln_conc"])  

# The linear regression result object, fit, contains slope in fit.slope
print("Slope =",fit.slope.round(4))          # all floating point values have a .round() method that can be applied
print("Intercept =",fit.intercept.round(2))  # Type dir(fit) to see all the variable, methods and functions 
print("R =", fit.rvalue.round(4))
print("slope STDEV =",fit.stderr.round(8))    
print("intercept STDEV =", fit.intercept_stderr.round(6))


# ## Summary
# 
# We can import or create a **dataframe** and we can apply math operations to the columns. We can **add** new columns, **replace** data in a column or **drop** (delete) columns. Then we can **visualize** a plot of any pair of columns as an *x,y* plot. We can obtain the **slope and intercept** of the linear fit quickly and easily.  
# 
# ### Is It Worth It?
# 
# The above could all be done in **MS *Excel*** easily. You would have to code the spreadsheet just like this notebook. You will set up **formulas**, identify cells that represent calculated values, etc. However, there will be no documented **method** that you can examine later. And you cannot take a spreadsheet and use the code in another tool. 
# 
# Using *Python* for **everything** will enable complicated workflows to be eventually **constructed** from the simple bricks that you are building now. There are many language options available and you will someday choose others depending on your experience and needs. However, **for now**, we can do everything with *Python*.
# 
# ### A Challenge
# 
# You are challenged to **repurpose** this notebook to serve as a **calculator** for determining the rate constant of a first-order reaction when given a set of concentrations at given times. I bet you can make it much shorter. Once a tool is made, it can be used **again and again**. Just keep it sharp and well oiled.
